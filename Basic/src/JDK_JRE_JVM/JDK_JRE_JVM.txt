JVM:(java virtual machine)
-Loads the code
-Verifies code
-Execute code
-Provide runtime environment				Just provides Environment
-physically does not exist
-Platform indepedent

JRE:(java runtime environment)
-Implementation of JVM
-For running java code JRE is required
-JRE has libraries that JVM uses them at runtime		TO RUN CODE
-physically exist
-Platform dependent

JDK:(java development tools)
-Full featured Software development kit			TO RUN CODE+PROGRAMMING
-Contains JRE and Development tools


HOW  CODE IS RUNNING??
-COMPLATION
-EXECUTION

(1)COMPLATION:
-SOURCE CODE-->COMPILER-->BYTE CODE
                [JDK]
(2)EXECUTION:
-BYTE CODE CAN RUN ANY OPREATING SYSTEM
-BYTE CODE-->[JVM]-->NATIVE CODE
