FUNCTION:

--i/p-->{block of code}----->o/p
        [operation perform]

METHODS:
--i/p-->{block of code}----->o/p
        [operation perform]

-FUNCTION'S syntax:
return type functionName(parametes){
    operations;
}

-for example
public static int add(int a, int b){        //'PUBLIC' AND 'STATIC' IS A KEYWORD
    int c=a+b;
}

-WHAT HAPPEN IN MEMORY??
-function are stored in memory-->stack formation(means one by one)
-fuctions variable are stored in stack frame (stored same things in stack termed as stack frame)

-DIFFRENCE BETWEEN FUNCTIONS AND METHOD??
-functions are directly call
--and methods are call through the class's object


//practice questions
1]make a fuctions to add two number and retrun the sum
2]make a functions to multiply two number and return the product
3]find the factorial of a number
